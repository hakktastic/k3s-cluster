# k3s-cluster
This repository contains resources to configure my Raspberry Pi cluster which runs a lightweigth k8s cluster from rancher's k3s.

## Upgrade
Upgrade of the K3S-cluster is done automated. See: [https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated](https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated) for documentation. All files needed for the system upgrade are placed in [scripts/k3s/system-upgrade](https://github.com/hakktastic/k3s-cluster/tree/master/scripts/k3s/system-upgrade).
